## 🛠️ What I Built Today  

**🏗️ Session Highlights**  
-  Was able to add some simple styling to the application and make the home page look a bit cleaner

**💡 Key Breakthroughs**  
-  Have a very basic understanding of the Tailwind 'Utility first' approach, as I initially tried tackling the styling in classes but that's not really the Tailwind way

## 🐛 Bugs / Blockers  

-  Spent too long looking at TailwindCSS docs wondering why i couldn't run a specific command.. only to find out I was looking at the docs for V2 (we're on V4.1 as of writing this)
	- ChatGPT led me astray, let this teach you to trust you own gut more often

## 📝 General Notes / Day Summary  

-  Decided to pause on working on the firebase course so can instead get myself programming and building again
	- Can learn how to use firebase when I get to the part of actually implementing it, instead of worrying about watching tutorials on it when I can get hands on experience with it 
- Set up a Notion job tracker that I will start using once my resume's and cover letter's have been updated
	- Was able to get a good start on my web dev one, but need to create a new IT one

## 🔮 Next Steps / Tomorrow  

- [ ] Create tailored resume for both WD and IT jobs
- [ ] Create tailored cover letter as well
