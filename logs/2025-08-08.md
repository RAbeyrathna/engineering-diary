## 📝 General Notes / Day Summary  

-  Didn't end up doing firebase work but made up for it by doing some work on my homelab n8n instance
- Experimented and tinkered with docker, learning how to manage files within my docker instance so I could migrate a local version of n8n and move all the data to my domain hosted version
- Watched a little bit of firebase but didn't end up doing any coding, will hopefully make time tomorrow to continue to work on that
