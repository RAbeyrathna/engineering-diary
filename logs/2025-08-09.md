## 📝 General Notes / Day Summary  

-  Network outage in my area, causing my internet to intermittenly go out and run extremely slow
- Wasn't able to do any work on Firebase as a result, so decided to start working on a project instead to get myself coding again
- Created and started 2 git repos for Pokémon inspired apps
	- A Pokémon cry quiz as a simple project to get me coding again, and to practice the new technologies i've learn to get some momentum going
	- A Pokémon to do list that will have authentication, firebase and motivates users to complete their tasks by looking after a Pokémon
		- This will greatly benefit me personally which will hopefully motivate me to actually complete it
