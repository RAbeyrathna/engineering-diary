## 📅 Daily Logs (`logs/`)

**Purpose:** Capture what you did, what you learned, and what blocked you — so progress is always visible.  

- **File format:** `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **When to write:** Every day I code (minimum 5 minutes)
- **Template Sections:**
  - 🌅 *Morning Plan & Priorities* → today’s main goals
  - 🔋 *Energy & Mood* → track consistency & habits
  - 🛠️ *What I Built Today* → code, experiments, or milestones
  - 📚 *Learnings* → key takeaways, with resources if possible
  - 🐛 *Bugs / Blockers* → issues and plan to fix
  - 🔮 *Next Steps / Tomorrow* → checklist for the next session

✅ **Aim:** Show consistent daily growth and spot patterns in learning.

## 📆 Weekly Reviews (`reviews/`)

**Purpose:** Step back to reflect on the big picture, celebrate wins, and adjust course.  

- **File format:** `reviews/week-XX.md`
- **When to write:** Every Sunday night
- **Template Sections:**
  - ✅ *Wins* → things I’m proud of this week
  - 😅 *Struggles* → what challenged me
  - 📘 *Learnings* → key lessons or breakthroughs
  - 🍒 *Next Week Goals* → 3–4 actionable items

✅ **Aim:** Turn small daily logs into a clear weekly growth story.

## 💻 Project Plans (`projects/`)

**Purpose:** Track each project’s scope, progress, and lessons learned.  

- **File format:** `projects/project-name.md`
- **When to write/update:** Whenever I start or make progress on a project
- **Template Sections:**
  - 🎯 *Goal* → why I’m building this project
  - 🧩 *Features Roadmap* → checklist of features
  - 📅 *Timeline* → milestones & deadlines
  - 🛠️ *Tech Stack* → tools & frameworks used
  - 📚 *Lessons Learned* → new insights from building
  - 📝 *Notes* → anything worth recording

✅ **Aim:** Build a portfolio of thoughtful, documented projects.

## 🔁 Habit Rules

- 🕒 **Daily:** Write a log after each coding session (no skipping, even if short).
- 📆 **Weekly:** Reflect every Sunday night before bed.
- 💡 **Projects:** Update files as soon as new progress is made — don’t wait until the end.

> 💬 *“The best way to learn is to build, reflect, and repeat.”*
