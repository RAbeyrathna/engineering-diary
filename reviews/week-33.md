# 📆 Weekly Review – Week 33

This was my first week getting started with working on my projects and coding again. Wasn't the strongest week but we have to start somewhere, and I think the habit of writing in my dev journal is helping keep me accountable, and also motivates me to get something done every day - even if it is just something super small.
